# Hello 👋, Welcome to the SOA Exercises Repository ! 🚀
This repository is a comprehensive collection of exercises on Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), covering essential concepts like asynchronous messaging, microservices, and event-driven design. 🏗️

📌 What’s Inside?
✅ Hands-on SOA exercises with step-by-step implementation.
✅ Practical use of Docker, Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ for message-driven architectures.
✅ Examples showcasing loose coupling, scalability, and observability.
✅ Integration of logging and monitoring using Prometheus, Elastic Stack.

🚀 Tech Stack
🔹 Docker 🐳 – Containerized services for easy deployment.
🔹 RabbitMQ 🐰 – Message broker for async communication.
🔹 Apache Kafka ⚡ – Distributed event streaming for scalable microservices.
🔹 Python / Node.js 🐍🌍 – Implementation of publisher/consumer services.

📖 Learning Outcomes
💡 Understand SOA principles & asynchronous messaging.
💡 Build real-world microservices with message brokers.
💡 Learn to monitor & log events for better observability.
